   		<p>The game is played between two teams of eleven, 10 field players and one goal keeper, are permitted to be on the
		 pitch at any one time. The remaining players may be substituted in any combination. There is an unlimited number 
		 of times a team can sub in and out. Substitutions are permitted at any point in the game, apart from between the 
		 award and end of a penalty corner; two exceptions to this rule is for injury or suspension of the defending goalkeeper,
		 which is not allowed when playing with a field keep, or a player can exit the field, but you must wait until after 
		 the inserter touches the ball to put somebody back in.</p>
		  
		<break></break>

		<p>Players are permitted to play the ball with the flat of the 'face side' and with the edges of the head and handle of the field hockey 
		stick with the exception that, for reasons of safety, the ball may not be struck 'hard' with a forehand edge stroke, because of the 
		difficulty of controlling the height and direction of the ball from that stroke.</p>

        <p>The flat side is always on the "natural" side for a right-handed person swinging the stick at the ball from right to left. 
		 Left-handed sticks are rare, but available; however they are pointless as the rules forbid their use in a game. 
		 To make a strike at the ball with a left-to-right swing the player must present the flat of the 'face' of the stick to the ball by 
		 'reversing' the stick head, i.e. by turning the handle through approximately 180° (while a reverse edge hit would turn the stick head 
		 through approximately 90° from the position of an upright forehand stroke with the 'face' of the stick head).</p>

		<p>Edge hitting of the ball underwent a two-year "experimental period", twice the usual length of an "experimental trial" and is still a matter
		 of some controversy within the game. Ric Charlesworth, the former Australian coach, has been a strong critic of the unrestricted use of 
		 the reverse edge hit. The 'hard' forehand edge hit was banned after similar concerns were expressed about the ability of players to direct 
		 the ball accurately, but the reverse edge hit does appear to be more predictable and controllable than its counterpart. This type of 
		 hit is now more commonly referred to as the "forehand sweep" where the ball is hit with the flat side or "natural" side of the stick and not
		  the rounded edge.</p>

		<p>Other rules include; no foot-to-ball contact, no use of hands, no obstructing other players, no high back swing, no hacking, 
		and no third party. If a player is dribbling the ball and either loses control and kicks the ball or another player interferes that 
		player is not permitted to gain control and continue dribbling. The rules do not allow the person who kicked the ball to gain advantage 
		from the kick, so the ball will automatically be passed on to the opposing team. Conversely, if no advantage is gained from kicking the ball,
		 play should continue. Players may not obstruct another's chance of hitting the ball in any way. No shoving/using your body/stick to prevent 
		 advancement in the other team. Penalty for this is the opposing team receives the ball and if the problem continues, the player can be carded. 
		 While a player is taking a free hit or starting a corner the back swing of their hit cannot be too high for this is considered dangerous. 
		 Finally there may not be three players touching the ball at one time. Two players from opposing teams can battle for the ball, however if another
		 player interferes it is considered third party and the ball automatically goes to the team who only had one player involved in the third party.</p>
